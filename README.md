# Search Engine
I build a search engine that allows a user to enter a search into their browser, and then searches over a bank of webpages. A similiarity score is calculated between the search query and all the pages on the "internet". The results are stored in a min_heap, allowing the user to access the k most similiar webpages. 

I implement the min heap from scratch in this exercise, as well as use a DoubleLinkedList and a ChainedHashDictionary that I implemented in another project.
